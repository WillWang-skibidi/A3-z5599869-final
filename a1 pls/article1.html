                    It is clear to many that the government only loves renewable and sustainable energy when it has applications to their military industrial complex. Whether it be nuclear powered submarines or something else, it didn't take long for the military to recognise the many potiential possibilites the BIOPODS provided in weaponised utilities.  
                </b></h2>
                <h2><b>
