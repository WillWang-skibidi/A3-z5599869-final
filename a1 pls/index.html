                    <p>Hey folks, it’s me again, hauling waste in this grimy city, again. Most of you may know already but I've been slaving away at this job for 15 years, and let me tell you, I’ve seen some shit—literally and figuratively. The trucks still rumble, the pipes still clog, and the stink never quits. But lately, there’s a new kind of stink in the air, and it’s not coming from the sewers. It’s the smell of greed, and it’s all tied to those fancy new Bio pods.
                        <br><br>
                    You’ve probably heard about them by now. Those little biodegradable pills or whatever the hell they be selling that turn our crap into fuel?  I mean "The People’s Output Organisation", that literally spells out poo, hokum, that’s some next level Corpo shit. 
                        <br><br>
                    They rolled them out a few months back, promising a cleaner world, a sustainable future, all that jazz. I’ll admit, when I first heard about it, I was kinda stoked. I mean, I spend my days knee-deep in what these tablets turn into liquid gold. Imagine a world where my job isn’t just cleaning up after everyone.
                        <br><br>
                    But here’s the tea, it’s not turning out to be like that at all . Not even close. The Bipods work, sure. I’ve seen the conversion setups at the treatment plants. Big, shiny tanks pumping out fuel like it’s nobody’s business. People's places  with septic tanks are starting to rig up their own mini gas stations. Sounds great, right? Except the tech isn’t for us regular folks. Not really. The big dogs, freaking Corpo rats with their skyscrapers and private jets, see, the Bio pod tech is still “preliminary,” or so they say. Limited supply, high production costs, blah blah blah. That’s the excuse they’re using to jack up prices and gatekeep access. Only the rich neighbourhoods get the subsidized converters, while the rest of us are still flushing and forgetting, no fuel in sight. Worse, I’m hearing whispers from the plant that some of these corporations are buying up entire waste streams. Yeah, you read that right, literally trying to monopolise our shit.
                        <br><br>
                    They’re outbidding municipal plants for the raw material to fuel their factories and, get this, their private militias, who knows what the hell that means but god I hate to just imagine what that would be capable of, eternal tanks or jets or something 
                        <br><br>
                    I’m no scientist, but I know enough to see where this is going. The Bio pods could’ve been a game-changer. Cleaner than EVs, no strip-mining required, just us humans doing what we do best, doing jack diddly squat. But instead of leveling the playing field, it’s just another tool for the suits to tighten their grip. They’re not just controlling the fuel now; they’re controlling us, down to what comes out of our bodies. 
                        <br><br>
                    Anyway, I gotta clock out d. Just needed to get this off my chest. Keep flushing, folks, but don’t be surprised if someone shady is making a buck off it.
                        <br><br>

                At the turn of the 22nd century  scientists have finally achieved a new milestone in humanity's journey to total sustainability, What did they make?<br><br>

                The Technology of turning human waste into energy and or fuel has been avaliable for almost a century however due to the ineffeiecny of the conversion rate and expensive costs it has not beem widespread at all and wasn't seen as a good enough substitute to fossil fuels or Electronic alternatives till now. Being more sustainable than EV's that still require mineral mining and being one small step below an engine that runs on water, the scientests at the People's Output Organisation created the biopods.<br><br>
                
                The Biopod is a biodegradeable tablet that when its contents inside the tablet meet with the various cehmical compounds that make up human fecal matter, beings a synthetical process that transforms the matter and gasses into a liquid that is useable as a fuel source. The technology is still in its pelminary stages as a commerical product and the main primary use by consumers as an applciation to convert the household septic tank into a gas station pump esentially. However businesses and factories are surely rapidly theorising other ways to adapt this technology to their preexisting systems.<br><br>
                
                As oil reserves have drastically dwindled for the past couple centuries and the fact a single human produces up to 665 kilograms of bodily waste a year, Biopods have generally been well recieved by the general public, recognising it for its overall incredible potiential for sustainability and benefits for the environment. As a fuel source, its mileage is double of traditional fossil fuels and almost triple compared to diesel fuel.

                <h3 id="overlay">Biopods were also met with various forms of backlash, most notably coming from the sanitation department and workers who viewed the technology as a uneccessary threat to their profession. WHile The People's Output Organisation publicly stated that there was no direct intention to penetrate the sanitation business and risk thousands of losing their jobs, the union has stood behind workers and are now in talks with the government to find a solution.

This was mostly a result of the shocking numbers seen in the 2095 oil reserve consensus, that is a general data analysis of the how mant million barrels of oil is produced a day in that specific year.
